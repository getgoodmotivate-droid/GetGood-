# 🚀 DEPLOYMENT SETUP - Step by Step

## ✅ Step 1: Git Repository Created (DONE!)

Your local git repository is ready with all your app files committed.

## 📋 Next Steps for You:

### Step 2: Create GitHub Repository

**Go to:** https://github.com/new

**Fill out:**
- Repository name: `getgood` (or `getgood-fitness`)
- Description: `Fitness tracking app with AI coach, milestones, and transformations`
- Make it **Public** (so Vercel can access it)
- **Don't** initialize with README (we already have one)

**Click "Create repository"**

### Step 3: Connect Your Local Code to GitHub

After creating the GitHub repo, you'll see commands like this. Run them in your terminal:

```bash
git remote add origin https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/getgood.git
git branch -M main
git push -u origin main
```

**Replace `YOUR_USERNAME` with your actual GitHub username!**

### Step 4: Deploy to Vercel

**Go to:** https://vercel.com

**Sign in with GitHub** (easiest option)

**Click "New Project"**

**Import your `getgood` repository**

**Deploy settings:**
- Framework Preset: **Vite** (should auto-detect)
- Build Command: `npm run build` (should be auto-filled)
- Output Directory: `dist` (should be auto-filled)
- Install Command: `npm install` (should be auto-filled)

**Click "Deploy"**

**Wait 2-3 minutes** ⏱️

### Step 5: Get Your Live URL! 🎉

You'll get a URL like: `https://getgood-abc123.vercel.app`

**This is your live app!** Share it with anyone!

```

### Vercel Issues:
- Make sure GitHub repo is **Public**
- Check that build completed successfully
- Look at Vercel build logs for errors

### Mobile Issues:

# App updates automatically! 🚀
```
